ehco was my team's entry in the Sydney 2014 Global Game Jam; it won the best Audio Award thanks to the music made by [Brad Gentle](https://www.facebook.com/AllBetrayingEdan)

It was made in 48 hours, I coded the game mechanics, helped design the concept and integrated [Hee-eun Yeo's hand-made watercolour art](http://windandmill.com).

**Original Description bye Leo Turem:**

Explore four seasonal micro-planets in this VR-enabled experience.

Concept: Life is a journey riddled with challenges posed by our environment, those around us, and ourselves. By reflecting on our pasts and our futures, we can reconcile them in order to move forward down the path laid before us. Some paths are harder than others; your path is yours to tread, but you needn't tread it alone.

Each planet is a mirrored image of the present in a different stage of life. There is a reflection of you on each planet, you can see it follow your moves when standing at certain planet meridians.The seed also has a reflection, but as a grown tree in Summer.
